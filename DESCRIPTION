Title: Methods for Clustering Mixed-Type Data
Description: Implements methods for clustering mixed-type data,
  specifically combinations of continuous and nominal data. Special attention
  is paid to the often-overlooked problem of equitably balancing the
  contribution of the continuous and categorical variables. This package
  implements KAMILA clustering, a novel method for clustering
  mixed-type data in the spirit of k-means clustering. It does not require
  dummy coding of variables, and is efficient enough to scale to rather large
  data sets. Also implemented is Modha-Spangler clustering, which uses a
  brute-force strategy to maximize the cluster separation simultaneously in the
  continuous and categorical variables. For more information, see Foss, Markatou,
  Ray, & Heching (2016) <doi:10.1007/s10994-016-5575-7> and Foss & Markatou
