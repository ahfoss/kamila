\description{
A function that classifies a new data set into existing KAMILA clusters
using the output object from the kamila function.
}
\details{
A function that takes obj, the output from the kamila function, and newData,
a list of length 2, where the first element is a data frame of continuous
variables, and the second element is a data frame of categorical factors.
Both data frames must have the same format as the original data used
to construct the kamila clustering.
